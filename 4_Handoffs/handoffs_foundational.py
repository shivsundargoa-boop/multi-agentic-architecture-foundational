handoffs_foundational.py
========================

A FOUNDATIONAL, runnable example of the HANDOFFS pattern, built with LangGraph and
OpenAI GPT-4o. Companion to sub_agents_foundational.py and router_foundational.py.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT MAKES HANDOFFS DIFFERENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sub-agents and Router have a coordinator that stays in charge. Handoffs has no
coordinator: the ACTIVE agent changes as the conversation moves through stages, and
each agent TRANSFERS control to the next when its part is done.

Three properties define the pattern, and this file shows all three:

  1. Control transfer  -- each stage agent "hands off" to the next by setting who is
     active next. (In a real system this is a tool the agent calls; here each agent
     sets a `handoff` field, and routing activates that stage.)
  2. State carried forward -- details collected in one stage are available in later
     stages. A MemorySaver checkpointer persists state across the user's turns.
  3. Sequential stage-gating -- a stage unlocks only after the previous one finishes.
     You cannot reach eligibility before intake is complete, or submission before the
     applicant is found eligible. The graph's structure enforces this.

Domain: a loan-application assistant.  intake -> eligibility -> submit

    START -> intake (collect details) --handoff--> eligibility (check)
              |                                        |
         [user turn]                           eligible? --> submit (confirm) --> END
                                                     \--> rejected --> END

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW THE USER TURNS WORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The graph runs as ONE session that PAUSES (via interrupt) whenever it needs input
from the applicant -- once in intake (to collect details) and once in submit (to
confirm). Between pauses, control is handed from agent to agent automatically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
