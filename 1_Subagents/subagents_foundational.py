sub_agents_foundational.py
==========================

A FOUNDATIONAL, runnable example of the SUB-AGENT pattern
(also called the supervisor / orchestrator-worker pattern),
built with LangGraph and OpenAI GPT-4o.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THIS TEACHES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
One SUPERVISOR coordinates several specialised SUB-AGENTS. On each turn the
supervisor:

    1. reads the user's request,
    2. decides which ONE specialist to consult next,
    3. hands that specialist a FOCUSED task,
    4. reads the finding that comes BACK,
    5. decides again -- consult another specialist, or stop and synthesise.

Steps 4 -> 5 are the heart of the pattern. Results return to the supervisor,
and the supervisor RE-DELEGATES based on what came back. That "come back and
decide" loop is exactly what separates a supervisor from a one-pass router
(a router fans out once, merges, and stops -- it never loops).

Domain: mutual-fund analysis. A user asks for a rounded view of a fund, and
the supervisor pulls together four specialists -- performance, holdings, risk,
and fees -- then composes a balanced summary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT OUT (and why)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- No retrieval / RAG / vector store. The fund data is a small hard-coded dict
  below, so the ONLY thing on screen is the control flow. The next project
  swaps this synthetic data for real retrieval -> a "sub-agentic RAG".
- The supervisor consults specialists ONE AT A TIME and re-decides after each,
  so the loop is visible. Production supervisors often fan several out in
  parallel; that is an optimisation on top of the same idea.
